    <p>Jack, a poor country boy, trades the family cow for a handful of magic
    beans, which grow into an enormous beanstalk reaching up into the clouds. 
    Jack climbs <span id="cont"><a href="#" onclick="read()">....read more</a></span><span id="more"> the beanstalk and finds himself in the castle of an unfriendly
    giant. The giant senses Jack's presence and cries, “Fee, fie, fo, fum, I 
    smell the blood of an Englishman!” Outwitting the giant, Jack is able to 
    retrieve many goods once stolen from his family, including an enchanted goose 
    that lays golden eggs. Jack then escapes by chopping down the beanstalk. 
    The giant, who is pursuing him, falls to his death, and Jack and his family 
    prosper.</span></p>
